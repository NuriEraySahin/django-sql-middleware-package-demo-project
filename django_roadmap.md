  </div>
  <br>
  <div style="margin-left:5%"><i>Django Application Logic</i></div>
  <div style="margin-left:5%">  Django is a Python web framework that operates at a high level and adheres to the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture. The framework divides the application logic into three distinct layers: Model, View, and Template.</div>
  <div style="margin-left:5%">
  <li style="margin-top:3%">Model Layer: The Model layer encompasses the application's data and the corresponding business logic. The software offers a user interface for interacting with the database and establishes the structure of the data. The model layer in Django is established by creating Python classes that inherit from Django's base Model class. Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) translates the properties and relationships of the data into a database schema.</li>
    <li>View Layer: The View layer manages the user interface and the application logic. It engages with the Model layer to obtain and manipulate data and displays the response to the user. Django views are Python functions that accept HTTP requests and provide HTTP answers. Views are responsible for retrieving data from the Model layer and presenting it in a suitable format, such as HTML, JSON, or XML.</li>
      <li>Template Layer: The Template layer is responsible for managing the presentation logic. The purpose of this component is to establish the structure and appearance of HTML templates, and to display the content using the data supplied by the View. Django utilizes a templating language to enable developers to specify the organization and design of HTML pages. The templating language in Django has various functionalities, including template inheritance, filters, and tags, that facilitate the creation of reusable and maintained templates.</li>
      </div>
  <div style="margin-left:5%; margin-top: 3%">The URL routing mechanism in Django is responsible for mapping URLs to views. Django use URL pattern matching to ascertain which view to execute when a user requests a URL. After the execution of the view, it interacts with the Model layer to fetch data and the Template layer to generate the response. Django has an integrated administrative interface that enables developers to handle data and users without the need for coding.</div>

   <div style="margin-left:5%">
   The Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) module is a component of the Django web framework that allows developers to interface with databases using object-oriented APIs at a higher degree of abstraction, rather than directly writing SQL queries. The Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) facilitates the mapping of database tables to Python classes and database records to instances of those classes. This enables developers to manipulate database records as if they were ordinary Python objects.

<div style="margin-top:3%">The Django ORM was initially unveiled in the 0.90 release of the Django web framework in 2006. The initial implementation was built around the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) utilized in the Ruby on Rails framework. However, it has subsequently developed into a resilient and adaptable module that provides extensive support for various database backends.</div>

<div style="margin-top:3%">The Django ORM module is crucial in web development as it streamlines the database handling process, enabling developers to concentrate on the higher-level parts of their application logic rather than being overwhelmed by intricate database intricacies. Developers can enhance the cleanliness, maintainability, and testability of their code by utilizing the Django ORM. In addition, the Django ORM has extensive support for several database backends like as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle. This allows for seamless switching between multiple databases as project requirements evolve.</div>
<br>
<i>Comprehending Django Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)</i>
The Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Django is a robust tool that enables developers to manipulate a relational database by utilizing Python code, eliminating the need to write direct SQL queries. The Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) offers a sophisticated degree of abstraction above the database, simplifying the task for developers to handle intricate data structures.

Below are few fundamental principles to grasp while dealing with Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):

- Models: Models are Python classes that serve as representations of database tables. Every characteristic of the model symbolizes a column within the corresponding database tables.
- Fields: Fields specify the specific data type that can be placed in an attribute or column of a model. Django has a variety of pre-defined field types, including IntegerField, CharField, DateField, and more.
- QuerySets: QuerySets are utilized to retrieve data from the database through querying. Lazy evaluation is employed, indicating that the database query is executed only upon data access.
- Managers: Managers are entities that specify the methods for retrieving data from a model. Every model is equipped with a default manager, however, it is possible to create custom managers in order to apply filters or adjust querysets.
- Django offers various forms of associations between models, including ForeignKey, OneToOneField, and ManyToManyField. These relationships enable you to specify the connections between models.
- Migrations refer to files that provide a description of alterations made to the database structure. When modifications are made to your models, a migration file is generated to document these changes. The migration framework in Django can subsequently implement those modifications to the database.

Generally, Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a robust instrument that simplifies the process of interacting with relational databases in Python. By acquiring a comprehensive comprehension of these fundamental principles, you will possess the capability to effortlessly construct intricate web apps.

<i>Configuring Django Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)</i>
In order to establish Django ORM, it is necessary to adhere to the following procedures:

1. Django installation: Django may be installed using pip, a Python package management. Access a command prompt and enter the specified command: Execute the command "pip install Django" to install the Django framework.

<summary><b>IV. Advanced Django ORM Concepts</b></summary>
<br>
  <ul><i>Querying</i></ul>  
  <div style="margin-left:5%">
  Django ORM, short for Object-Relational Mapping, is a robust technology that enables you to communicate with a relational database using Python code. Django ORM enables the manipulation of database records through Python objects and functions, allowing for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of data.

<div style="margin-top:3%">The Django ORM has a QuerySet API, which enables you to execute intricate queries on your database. A QuerySet is a set of database items that can be manipulated by applying filters, ordering, and slicing operations to restrict the results to a particular subset.</div>

<div style="margin-top:3%">To execute a query, begin by instantiating a QuerySet object using the model that corresponds to the database table you wish to get data from. Subsequently, you have the ability to employ filters, arrange the outcomes, and obtain a portion of the entities by utilizing slicing. Ultimately, you may execute the query to retrieve the outcomes from the database.</div>

  <li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Advanced filtering with Q objects:</i></li>

  <div style="margin-left:3%">The Django ORM has Q objects, which enable the execution of intricate queries by utilizing logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT. Q objects allow for the creation of intricate filter expressions that merge many conditions.</div>
  <li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Chaining multiple filters and exclude methods:</i></li>

  <div style="margin-left:3%">The Django ORM provides the capability to link together many filters and exclude methods in order to construct intricate queries. When you concatenate multiple filters, each filter is applied to the results of the previous filter. When the **exclude** technique is utilized, it eliminates objects that meet the provided criteria.</div>
  <li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Using aggregates and annotations:</i></li>

  <div style="margin-left:3%">The Django ORM offers aggregates and annotations, which enable you to carry out calculations and group data. Aggregates are mathematical functions that carry out computations on a collection of data, such as determining the total sum or average. Annotations enable the addition of computed fields to the QuerySet.</div>
  <li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Performing subqueries with subquery expressions:</i></li>

  <div style="margin-left:3%">Django ORM offers subquery expressions that enable the execution of subqueries. A subquery is a nested query that enables the retrieval of data dependent on the outcome of another query. Subquery expressions enable the creation of subqueries that can be incorporated into a bigger query.</div>
  </div>
  <br>
  <ul><i>Model Relationships</i></ul>
  <div style="margin-left:5%">  
  The Django ORM provides support for several forms of relationships between models, such as OneToOne, ForeignKey, ManyToMany, and GenericForeignKey. These links enable the creation of intricate data models capable of representing a diverse array of real-world circumstances.

 <div style="margin-top:3%">In order to establish a connection between two models, you have the option to utilize a ForeignKey, ManyToManyField, OneToOneField, or GenericForeignKey field within the model's definition. Each field type denotes a distinct form of association between the models.</div>

  <li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Advanced queries with related objects:</i></li>
<div style="margin-left:3%">The Django ORM enables you to execute queries that involve linked objects by utilizing the double underscore notation. This syntax allows for the traversal of relationships between models and the filtering or ordering of objects based on related fields.</div>
  <li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Working with ManyToMany and OneToOne relationships:</i></li>
<div style="margin-left:3%">The Django ORM offers specific fields designed for handling ManyToMany and OneToOne relationships. The ManyToManyField is used to establish a relationship of many-to-many between two models, whereas the OneToOneField is used to establish a relationship of one-to-one between two models.</div>
  <li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Customizing default managers:</i></li>
  <div style="margin-left:3%">The Django ORM provides the ability to modify the default managers for your models. A manager's primary responsibility is to execute queries and retrieve QuerySet objects that accurately represent the data stored in the database.

In order to personalize a manager, you have the option to create a new manager class that inherits from the ** models.Manager ** the Manager class in your model definition.</div>

The Django ORM is a robust technology that enables seamless interaction with relational databases using Python code. The QuerySet API offers developers the ability to execute intricate queries on their databases. Furthermore, developers have the capability to implement filters, arrange outcomes in a specific sequence, and obtain portions of objects by slicing. Developers can utilize Q objects to implement advanced filtering and combine many filters to construct intricate queries. Annotations and aggregates are utilized to execute computations and categorize data. Subquery expressions allow developers to make subqueries within a bigger query, which enables them to access data based on the results of another query. Developers can construct intricate and effective online apps that rely on databases by acquiring expertise in these advanced ideas.

<br>
  <div style="margin-left:5%">Implementing CRUD operations in Django is uncomplicated due to the presence of the built-in Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and the framework's philosophy of providing a comprehensive set of tools and features. The Django Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) offers a sophisticated degree of abstraction for the database, enabling developers to interface with the database using Python classes and objects, instead of having to write direct SQL queries. By adopting this approach, the process of writing and managing code becomes more convenient, while also minimizing the risk of SQL injection attacks.

  <ul style="margin-top:3%"><i>Initiating the Project</i></ul>

Django models are Python classes that serve as representations of database tables. To construct a model, access the ** models.py ** file located in your application directory and establish your model using the Django Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).

  <ul><i>Creating Records</i></ul>
  
  <li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Developing a form that enables users to generate new records:</i></li>
  <div style="margin-left:3%">In Django, a form may be created by defining a Python class that inherits from the **django.forms module.Use either the "Form" class or the "django.forms.ModelForm" class. The **Form** class is utilized for constructing bespoke forms that are not associated with a model, whilst the **ModelForm** class is employed for constructing forms that are derived from a model.</div>

  <li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Managing the process of receiving and verifying form submissions:</i></li>
 <div style="margin-left:3%">In Django, the process of submitting a form is usually managed by a view function that handles the form data and provides a response. To manage the submission and validation of a form, you can write a view function that utilizes the **PostForm** to validate the data provided by the form and generate a new **Post** object.</div>

 <li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Persisting the newly created data into the database:</i></li>

<div style="margin-left:3%">In order to persist the newly created **Post** object in the database, we employ the save() method of the **PostForm**. This function instantiates a new **Post`** object using the data from the form and persists it in the database.

In the previously specified **create_post** view function, we invoke the **save()** method on the **PostForm** object to persist the newly created **Post** object in the database. This function handles the creation of a new **Post** object using the form data and then persists it in the database. After the new **Post** object is stored in the database, we can lead the user to the **post_detail** view, where the specific information of the new post is shown. Alternatively, we can lead the user to the comprehensive list of all posts, the page for creating new posts, or any other pertinent page.</div>

To develop a form in Django that enables users to create new records, you need to define a form class based on the model, handle form submission and validation in a view function, then save the new record to the database using the **save()** method of the form object. By following these instructions, you may facilitate users in effortlessly generating new records in your Django application.

  <ul><i>Reading Records</i></ul>

   <li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Presenting data in a list or table format:</i></li>
  <div style="margin-left:3%">In Django, you may create a view function that fetches entries from the database and provides them to a template for rendering, allowing you to show the records in a list or table format.</div>

<li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Enabling users to access and examine specific records:</i></li>

<div style="margin-left:3%">In order to enable users to access and examine individual records, you may create a view function that retrieves a single record from the database and then provides it to a template for display.</div>

<li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Implementing pagination to manage extensive data sets:</i></li>

<div style="margin-left:3%">When working with extensive data sets, it is crucial to incorporate pagination into your views in order to enhance efficiency and user experience. The built-in **Paginator** class in Django allows you to incorporate pagination into your views.</div>

<div style="margin-top:2%">To display records in a list or table, allow users to view individual records, and add pagination to handle large data sets in Django, you need to define view functions that retrieve data from the database and pass it to templates for rendering. Additionally, you can utilize Django's built-in tools such as the **get_object_or_404()** function and **Paginator** class to handle data retrieval and pagination. By following these instructions, you may develop a resilient and user-friendly interface for efficiently handling data in your Django application.</div>

To enable users to modify existing records in a Django application, it is necessary to develop a form that automatically populates the fields with the current data. This form should allow users to make modifications and then submit the changed data to the server for further processing. The following are the sequential instructions to execute this feature:

<li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Specify a URL path for the view that displays the update form: Define a URL pattern in your **urls.py** file that will correspond to a view function responsible for displaying the update form.</i></li>

<li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Define the function for the update form view: In your **views.py** file, create a function that will manage the submission of the form and modify the entry in the database. This function will have similarities to the create view function, however, it will populate the form fields with the current data for the record being updated.</i></li>

<li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Define the update form: In your **forms.py** file, create a form that will be utilized to modify the entry in the database. The form will resemble the create form, but it will automatically fill in the fields with the current data for the record being modified.</i></li>

<li style="margin-top:1%"><i>The update form template is a predefined structure that outlines the format and layout for modifying or editing existing information. Create a form in your **post_edit.html** template to facilitate the modification of the record. The structure of this form will resemble the create form, but it will automatically fill up the fields with the current data for the record that is being updated.</i></li>

<li style="margin-top:1%"><i>Modify the entry in the database: Once the user submits the modification form, the data will undergo validation and processing by the view function. This function will then utilize the **save()** method of the form's instance to update the entry in the database.</i></li>

<div style="margin-top: 2%">To enable users to modify existing records in a Django application, the procedure entails establishing a URL route, view function, form, and template. The template should populate the form fields with the current data, allowing users to make modifications. Once the changes are made, the revised data is submitted to the server for processing. By following these instructions, you may develop a user-friendly interface for efficiently handling data in your Django application.</div>

  <ul style="margin-top:2%"><i>Deleting Records</i></ul>

In order to incorporate a delete button for individual records in a Django application, it is necessary to generate a new view and URL route specifically designed to manage the deletion request. The following are the sequential procedures to execute this feature:
